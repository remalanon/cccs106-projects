## Challenges and Solutions

I had trouble activating the environment , but it is easily solved by using the Command Prompt instead of PowerShell.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this lab, I was able to set up my Python development environment, configure Visual Studio Code, and create a virtual environment for my projects. I also learned to apply basic syntax, and handle common errors. This activity helped me become more confident in preparing my tools and starting with Python programming.
